# Dehydrogenation of ethanol

Consider the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ethanol            â†’      acetaldehyde                      \+ H~2~
  ------------------ ------ --------------------------------- -------------
  \(1\)                     \(2\)                             \(3\)

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

With first order (surface) reaction rate coefficient $k_{r} = 0.45$ m/s.
The (zero flux) binary mass-transfer coefficients are
$k_{12} = 0.07\ m/s$, $k_{13} = 0.23\ m/s$ and $k_{23} = 0.23\ m/s$ at
operating condition $p = 1.0 \cdot 10^{5}\ Pa$ and $T = 548\ K$. The
bulk gas phase composition $x_{1} = 0.60$,
$x_{2} = 0.20$ and $x_{3} = 0.20$. Assume ideal gases. Assume a film
model is appropriate.

**Questions**:

a)  Write down the Maxwell-Stefan equations.

b)  Solve this system by direct numerical integration. What are the
    molar fluxes?

c)  Solve this system using exact 'matrix-method'.

d)  Make a linear approximation of the concentration profiles and solve
    the resulting algebraic equations.

e)  Solve this system using the approximate 'matrix-method' in a
    mass-average reference frame.

f)  Compare the accuracy of the different methods.
