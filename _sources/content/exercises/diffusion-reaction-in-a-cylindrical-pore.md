# Diffusion-reaction in a cylindrical pore

Simulate diffusion into a cylindrical dead-end pore with infinitely fast
reaction on the wall. The pore has radius $R = 1\ \mu m$ and length
$L = 5\mu m$. The diffusion coefficient in both radial and axial
direction is $D = 10^{- 5}\ \frac{m^{2}}{s}.$

**Questions:**

a)  Provide the governing PDE for the two-dimensional diffusion in the
    pore.

b)  What are the proper boundary conditions?

c)  Perform the spatial discretization of this (axial symmetric) 2D
    problem to obtain a matrix-vector equation.

d)  Provide a Python implementation.
